        <h2 class="titre">Cybercrime</h2>

        <p>Cybercrime is a fast-growing area of crime. More and more criminals are exploiting the speed, convenience and
            anonymity of the Internet to commit a diverse range of criminal activities that know no borders, either
            physical or virtual, cause serious harm and pose very real threats to victims worldwide.</p>

        <h2 class="titre">Drugs</h2>

        <p>he drug trade and its associated crimes continue to grow in most parts of the world.

            Global abuse and accessibility to drugs have become increasingly widespread as trafficking routes have
            become shorter, more diverse and borders more easily crossed.

            The drug trade involves growers, producers, couriers, suppliers, dealers and users and affects people in
            almost all of our member countries.</p>

        <h2 class="titre">Integrity in sport</h2>

        <p>Sport brings people together, transcending differences in language, culture and beliefs. Unfortunately, the
            integrity of sport is undermined by a number of crimes, including match-fixing, illegal gambling and doping.

            Organized criminal syndicates operate on a massive scale, targeting a wide range of sports, including (but
            not limited to) football, athletics, tennis and cycling. A number of different figures are at risk of being
            approached by criminals who wish to manipulate the outcomes of matches, for example, players, referees,
            managers and coaches.</p>

        <h2 class="titre">CBRNE</h2>

        <p>Terrorism that makes use of CBRNE materials (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosives)
            poses a clear threat to public health and safety, national security and economic and political stability on
            a global level. As such, the prevention of such incidents is of the highest priority.

            The threat of CBRNE terrorism is evolving and, with it, the risk of incidents intended to maximize the
            number of victims on a global scale. We know that terrorist groups are working hard to acquire CBRNE
            materials and the expertise to use them in their operations.</p>

        <h2 class="titre">Maritime piracy</h2>

        <p>In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of attacks on vessels by pirates, in
            particular in the Gulf of Aden, Somali Basin and the Indian Ocean. Vast areas of waters are affected making
            it a challenge to prevent maritime piracy incidents.

            Maritime piracy affects major shipping lanes, and puts at risk the lives of seafarers and merchant seamen
            from all over the world, of whom hundreds are taken captive each year.

            Millions of dollars in ransom payments are paid to pirates. It is believed that these payments are divided
            between the pirates, their leaders and those who finance them. Intelligence indicates that part of the money
            is reinvested abroad through Somali emigrants.</p>

        <h2 class="titre">Terrorism</h2>

        <p>Terrorism poses a grave threat to national security and the lives of individuals around the world. At
            police, we run a number of initiatives to support our member countries in their efforts to protect their
            citizens from terrorism in its many forms.</p>

        <h2 class="titre">Vehicle crime</h2>

        <p>Vehicle crime is a highly organized criminal activity affecting all regions of the whole world and with clear
            links to organized crime and terrorism. Vehicles are not only stolen for their own sake, but are also
            trafficked to finance other crimes. They can also be used as bomb carriers or in the perpetration of other
            crimes.
            The police Stolen Motor Vehicle (SMV) database is a vital tool in the fight against international vehicle
            theft and trafficking.

            It allows police in our member countries to run a check against a suspicious vehicle and find out instantly
            whether it has been reported as stolen. An international database of this nature is crucial as vehicles are
            often trafficked across national borders, sometimes ending up thousands of miles away from the location
            where they were stolen.

            In 2017, around 118,000 motor vehicles worldwide were identified as stolen, thanks to the SMV database. By
            the end of the year, the number of database records stood at almost 7.2 million.</p>
